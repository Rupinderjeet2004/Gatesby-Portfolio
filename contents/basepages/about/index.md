<p>The main objective of my life is to reduce the world hunger, this is kind a long-term goal of my life. I am fond of learning more about Marketing field to get more experience and skills about it to get an appropriate job. Then I would like to open my own business to earn more money so that I can raise funds for charity for needy people to satisfy one of their basic necessities and it is “food”. Moreover, a single person can not make a huge change in the world, he/she needs various types of help and contribution from others. Thus, I need to develop a wide network area by using social media applications to connect with more and more people from distinct nations and catch their attention towards world hunger, which can attract them make a contribution to make the world hunger free and a better place to live in.</p>
